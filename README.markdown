### of the Tutorial by James Malloy

There are many tutorials on writing your own operating system.

The osdev.org [wiki website](http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones "Bare Bones for Beginners") is a great place to get started.  After
a recommendation on [*Hacker News*](http://news.ycominator.com "HN Home page"), I decided to use [James Malloy's tutorial](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/ "Tutorial start").

This git repository is my progress through it.

**N.B.**    New readers should note that Malloy's tutorial is out of date with respect to some of Boch's settings.  See the **bugs** file.
